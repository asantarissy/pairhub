# PairHub

This is the repo of [pairhub.io](https://pairhub.io), an open source community and web app to find remote pair programming buddies, being developed by [@gustavlrsn](https://twitter.com/gustavlrsn).

Sketch of landing page:

Core features:
- GitHub login and usernames, and public profile page (_possibly_ some sort of reputation system)
- A project/groups structure (join/create groups around open source projects, technologies, courses, your own ideas etc, to solve _**what** should we pair program on_, and _**who** shall I pair program with_)

### Tech stack
Initial tech stack of Meteor & React will be depreciated (moved to it's own [branch](https://github.com/pairhub/pairhub/tree/meteor)) and replaced by new stack:
- GraphQL with Apollo
- React
- Next.js
- Bootstrap 4 (through the [reactstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap) package)
